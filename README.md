# ALIBI - Algorithm for Linearization by Incremental graph BuIlding

## Input
ALIBI requires as input a GFA file with a sequence graph.

## Output
ALIBI linearizes the genome sequence graph present in the input file. The final linearized graph is written to a GFA file.

## Usage
Let ```/path/to/alibi/``` denote the path to ALIBI root directory.
```
bash /path/to/alibi/bin/alibi.sh -i <input_file>
```
